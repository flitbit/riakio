# Riak Interface Objects (riakio)

The **Riak Interface Objects** provides a set of utility classes and patterns for interacting with [Riak](http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/)'s [HTTP API](http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/references/apis/http/).

You may have found this page while looking for the excellent [riak-js](http://riak-js.org/). I started this project duing the year or so that riak-js wasn't being maintained... it remains a work in progress.
